    <h1>WebGL experiments</h1>

    <p>
      This is a collection of my attempts to learn WebGL. I don't
      guarantee that all of it is good code - some of the tutorials I
      followed contained some pretty bad code. But rather than refactor
      in place, I tended to create a new experiment and improve the code
      there.

      Mostly following along with 
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kB0ZVUrI4Aw"> IndigoCS WebGL Tutorial 1 </a>.
      It's a simple colored triangle, but a complete WebGL program. 
      I restructured his code a little, but for the most part, it's a directly copy.

      Move from a simple triangle to a full cube. Includes backface
      culling and index buffers.

      Loading external geometry and textures. Not really happy with code
      organization at this point; I broke the code up a bit into
      separate functions, but it really needs to be separate modules.
